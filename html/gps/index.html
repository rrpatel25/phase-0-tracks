#Comment/Answer: The purpose of the HTML5 semantic tags is to let the user and browser know what is being rendered and in what order. By having a general template/format, the browser can know how to go about rendering the page in an organized manner. The most useful tags are the ones that show up with any html page: the html, head, title, and body tags, because it helps organize the information in a meaningful manner for both the user and browser. The order the browser uses is from top to bottom, where tags/information towards the top is rendered and displayed first. In this challenge, I learned about Sublime snippets, a concept that I didn't know existed until the gps session. I think it is very useful to know and use later on because it helps create a personlized template for the user/me if I see a theme with projects and a personal template can be utilized to keep me organized. The most difficult concept was knowing how to properly utilize the individual semantic elements, as in how they should be organized within a basic html page. I can improve my understanding of this concept by looking at more examples of their use by other developers to get a better understanding of how best to utilize them.
