// Pseudocoding a reverse function

// For the reverse function, there is a string input
// The function will take the length of the string
// and while some counter is less than the length of the string
// the body of the function will take the last letter of the string input
// and add it to a new empty string.
// The counter will move up 1, causing the function to check the second-to-last letter
// and adding it to the empty string containing the 1 previous letter.
// This function goes on for as long as the length of the string.
