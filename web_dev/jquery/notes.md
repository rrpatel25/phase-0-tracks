# Tackling jQuery

* Try to find online resources that offer a tutorial, particularly in a video format
* If going through a video, just take notes and reference time marks of features
* Take a break after an hour to stretch and gauge progress on the learning
* If needed, might need to search for other resources/ask others for recommendations
* Having an example file to look at would help ensure proper formatting
* Save all important resources/bookmark

* W3 schools offered the best tutorial and examples, which was precisely what I needed
* Talking to others helped in streamlining important resources and information
