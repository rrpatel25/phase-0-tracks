# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows users to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files and merge revisions made by different people. This allows multiple developers to work on a different aspects of a project simultaneously while tracking what elements are added/edited, review and revert changes, and create backups in the code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a "copy" of one's master project within which the individual can work on. A branch is used to work on elements of a project without touching or disturbing the master code. This is an added layer of safety for the master code in case things go awry or if the branch code doesn't make the cut. Branches also allow multiple developers to work on different parts of the project simultaneously, which can then be merged back into the original project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is when a save point is created for a project and associated files and folders. The commit message describes the save point for future reference. A good commit message is detailed and states what has changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when a current branch and the branch it wishes to merge with have different changes. One branch may have commits that the other doesn't, which results in conflict markers to appear when trying to merge. Resolutions need to be made to eventually assure agreement between the two branches, which will then allow a successful merge.
